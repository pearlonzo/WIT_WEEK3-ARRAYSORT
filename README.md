Arraysort 
A sorted array is an array data structure in which each element is sorted in numerical, alphabetical, or some other order, and placed at equally spaced addresses in computer memory. It is typically used in computer science to implement static lookup tables to hold multiple values which have the same data type.
                                              
                            OR 

    Sorting is the process of putting data in order; either numerically or alphabetically. It is often necessary to arrange the elements in an array in numerical order from highest to lowest values (descending order) or vice versa (ascending order).
